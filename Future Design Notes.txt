Second address mux:
	- speed_sel 00 is system_controller
	- speed_sel others is the address counter (to be written).

Address counter:
	- Must vary the increment amount based on speed_sel to get 60, 120, 1000 hz
	- Might run at 12 KHz (could be as low as 3 KHz).  The amount it increments could be an address every 12, 100, 200 cycles (1000, 120, 60 hz)
	- This is if the SRAM can read this quickly, which 1/80ns = 12.5 MHz so should be good
	- Presumably the PWM device should run at this same speed?
	- Therefore need a clk_en signal whatever rate we choose.  The address_counter would have a increment_sel mux based on speed_sel to make the address change at whatever rate we want
	- The address is the top 8 out of 32 bits, so the increment_sel mux chooses a whole number that is 1/12, 1/100, 1/200 the value of the LSB of the top bytecisc
	
DONE:
Must write address_counter - Aaron
Must finish filter - Cameron: I (Aaron) think this is good now?
Must write I2C controller - Aaron
Must make top_level connections (both muxes will be contained in this) - Weston & Aaron

IN PROGRESS:
Must finish DE2_115 connections - Aaron

NOT STARTED:
Debugging (obviously)
